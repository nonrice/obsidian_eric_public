This unit is on imperfect competition. Imperfect competition is anything that is not perfect competition, which means it is defined as competition where barriers to entry do exist, and companies have at least some control over their price.
## Monopolies
A monopoly is the extreme of imperfect competition. There is one firm which also acts as the entire market. This happens because of high barriers to entry and/or special privileges (e.g. patents, ownership of materials). Most courts will also say a company has monopoly power if it conducts more than 50% of the sales in their market. While monopolies seem bad, some monopolies are actually good. For example, a business acting as a monopoly is sometimes so large, it creates economies of scale that make prices lower for consumers than if there existed multiple smaller companies. This is usually seen in utilities companies, where an entire region is usually served by one or two companies.

#### Monopoly graph
![[assets/Non_Price_Discriminating_Monopoly.svg]]
This is a production graph for a monopoly. Because a monopoly business is the market, the demand is downward sloping, like a typical market.
#### Why is MR<D?
This is because in a market, the amount customers are willing to pay are on a spectrum. Say you decrease price by some amount so a person willing to pay $x$ will buy your product. Your marginal revenue seems like it will also be $x$- however, because you decreased the price, people who originally were paying $>x$ will now pay $x$. Therefore, you also incur a loss of some degree, which explains why marginal revenue will never match the demand. 
#### Profit Maximization in Monopoly
A monopolist always wants to maximize profit, so they will produce the the quantity such that MR=MC. However, you always sell on the demand curve, so the total revenue will be as it is marked on the graph. 
#### Revenue Maximization in Monopoly
![[assets/Revenue_Vs_Quantity.svg]]
MR is the derivative of revenue with respect to quantity. This means when MR goes to $0$, revenue experiences a local extrema. We know when the quantity is initially $0$ and more units are sold, total revenue goes up, so in this case when MR=$0$, the revenue experiences an absolute maximum. Given MR we can also determine the elasticity of demand using the total revenue test (as shown).
#### Efficiency
A business is allocatively efficient if it produces at the societally optimal amount (where S=D). The supply curve for a business has an equivalent definition to its marginal cost. So given a monopoly graph, the societally optimal mount is where MC=D. However, it is easy to see that unless MR=D, you can never produce that MC=D. So monopolies are not allocatively efficient

A business is productively efficient if it produces units at the lowest cost per unit. Given MC intersects ATC at the lowest cost per unit, it is also impossible for a monopoly to produce here, if MR<D.
#### Natural Monopolies
![[assets/Natural_Monopoly.svg]]
A natural monopoly is when the total cost consistently goes down between quantity $0$ and a socially optimal quantity. From the visual, it is clear if there is a natural monopoly, then the cost of two firms each producing half of the socially optimal quantity is greater than the cost of one firm producing all of the socially optimal quantity. Note that natural monopolies do not have to produce at the socially optimal quantity- the only way to guarantee it is to regulate them to do so.
#### Price Discrimination
Price discrimination is when each consumer is charged exactly the amount they are willing to pay. Practically, this is impossible, though some companies do make attempts at it. Recall the reason that MR is less than demand is that monopolies have no way to price discriminate. So if perfect price discrimination is employed, MR=D. This results in $0$ consumer surplus (consumer surplus is the amount of money that went "unspent"), higher profits, and allocative efficiency (because monopolies produce at MC=MR, and now MR=D, and allocative efficiency is when you produce at MC=D).
## Monopolistic Competition
This is the closest form of competition to perfect competition. This is where there are a large amount of companies competing in a market, but product differentiation, *some* barriers to entry and advertising means that companies do have some control over price. 
#### Short and Long run
The graph of a firm in monopolistic competition is the same as the graph of a monopoly. However, it is subject to change in the short and long run. In the short run, firms may make a profit or loss. However, in the long run, firms may enter if there is positive profit, or leave if there is negative profit, affecting for all the firms. It just so happens that this demand is affected in such a way that in the long run, the profit maximizing production will yield $0$ economic profit.
#### Excess Capacity
Recall that productive efficiency is when a firm produces at minimum ATC. In long-run monopolistic competition, firms will produce lower than the quantity required for productive efficiency. This difference in quantity is called excess capacity.
## Oligopolies
An oligopoly is the closest type of competition there is to a monopoly. An oligarchy is when a small group of people have control over a government, so an oligopoly is when a small group of firms have control over the market. The products in this market may be similar or different, but there will always exist high barriers to entry.
#### Game Theory
Game theory is the study of decision making. This applies to oligopolies because oligopolies are interdependent, since the small number of firms means the business decisions of one firm can affect the business of another firm. This means firms must engage in strategic decision making in order to do well in the market.
![[assets/Game_Theory_1.svg]]
While business decisions are often more complex, in this class strategy will be evaluated in 2x2 matrices, where each firm has two decisions. This particular diagram represents the payoff for both firms depending on their pricing. For example, if Firm 2 prices low and Firm 1 prices high, then Firm 1 earns $0$ and Firm 2 earns $30$. We will also assume nobody knows what the other person will do, and cannot "react" to another person's decision.

In this scenario it seems like both businesses should chose to price high, since they would both earn a net total of $40$ dollars. This is a socially optimal solution, because it is the best thing that can happen. However, this is not a stable solution. Look what happens when one business decides to price low- they will undercut the other business, taking all the profits. The business who prices high, expecting the other business to also price high, will be in for a rude awakening due to the selfish desire of the other business.

This shows that playing your own part of the socially optimal solution, in this case, it not optimal, since it risks you being undercut. A more sensible decision would be for both the firms to price low. This situation is a Nash equilibrium- it is when no player can better their position by changing their current strategy, when the other keeps his strategy. In this case, the strategy is to always price low. 

A dominant strategy is when a player's best decision is independent of the other player's decision. In 2x2 matrices, either both players have a dominant strategy, or nobody does. This is because if only one person has a dominant strategy, then the other person actually does have a dominant strategy, which is simply to pick the best response to the first person's dominant strategy. 

Sometimes there may be two Nash Equilibriums, but no dominant strategies. For example, consider the case:

While there are two Nash Equilibriums, nobody has a dominant strategy!
#### Colluding Oligopolies
Now it is apparent that the socially optimal solution is not always the Nash Equilibrium, so it may not occur. However, one method to cause the socially optimal solution to occur is collusion, where both oligopolies make a deal to choose the socially optimal solution. However, there often is an incentive to cheat this agreement, because for example, when you price low after you agreed with another company that you would both price high, you will earn more profit by undercutting him. As a result, collusion often needs to be enforced. This is hard to do because a legal contract would not work- collusion is illegal in most countries, so even if a contract is breached, you would not admit to a court that you attempted to participate in collusion. One potential (unethical) solution can be found in Mexico, where drug cartels enforce collusion in keeping drug prices high through threat of violence.
#### Price Leadership
Collusion is illegal, but it is clearly beneficial. So how would companies do this, without directly colluding? One way is through price leadership, a form of "unspoken" collusion. Here, one "leader" company always sets his price early. Then, the other companies will choose a similar price, reasoning by pricing too low they may lose on potential profit, and by pricing high they may lose sales. As a result, the members of the oligopoly have silently agreed upon a certain price. This situation is not stable, however, because at any moment a company could choose a low price to undercut everyone
#### Non-Colluding Oligopoly
This is the most pure form of an oligopoly. In this situation, companies will follow the rules of game theory to make optimal decisions.
#### Deviation from Equilibrium Price
When you deviate from your equilibrium price, your competitor may need to react. If you lower your price, your competitor must also lower his price in order to rebalance demands. However, if you increase your price, your competitor would simply ignore it, because increasing your price is a silly decision that lowers the demand for your product.
